# Learning Objectives

- show mastery of data wrangling techniques, including combining data across different sources and formats, data harmonization, and creation of new variables 
- create effective visual displays of complex information using R and Tableau
- create interactive visual presentations using Tableau

# Case Study Goals
Using data from the World Bank, CIA Factbook, or a complex data source of your own choosing, 
- create a Shiny app in R to illustrate an aspect of our world in data
- create an accompanying Tableau dashboard interactive visual presentation of our world in data
