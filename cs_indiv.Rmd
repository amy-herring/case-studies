# Learning Objectives

- learn to scrape data from HTML pages
- manipulate data obtained from HTML pages in R
- create helpful R functions to analyze web data and extract useful information
- create interactive function/app for analysis of identified data

# Case Study Goals

In the individual case study, you will design a Shiny app or other presentation/visualization of interesting data (e.g., data related to your career interests), presenting your work in class in December. Your presentation will lead the class through the resources you have designed.




# Data

- Data should be obtained via web scraping or use of a dynamic online resource. Software should be able to relatively easily accommodate regular updates to the data, to the extent possible.

# Reports

- Interim report 1: analysis plan for design of individual case study
- Interim report 2: draft of final report
- Final report: 3 page maximum written report and oral presentation in class, guides students through your newly designed resource
