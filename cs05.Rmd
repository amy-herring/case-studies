# Learning Objectives

- understand different types of missing data mechanisms and potential implications on validity of analysis results
- understand and apply statistical methods for survival analysis; understand role of missing data induced by censoring of events
- apply modern methods for handling missing data to analyze time-to-event data for Duke cardiology patients

# Case Study Goals

Based on data from the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Diseases, we will explore biological and sociodemographic factors related to survival. The goal is to describe both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for death, accounting as much as possible for potential biases due to missing data.

# Data (coming soon)
<!---
-Jiurui post data on Sakai with data dictionary linked here; variables to include in dataset include the following:  AGE_G, GENDER, RACE_G, YRCATH_G, CHFSEV, HXCEREB, HXCHF, HXCOPD, HXDIAB, HXHTN, HXMI, HXHYL, HXSMOKE, HEIGHT_R, WEIGHT_R, (calculate BMI from height and weight),  S3, LMST, LVEF_R, NUMDZV, DEATH, DAYS2LKA
-Jiurui let me know % with missing data for each variable. Also subset to one observation per person (repeat events are included, but there should be only one death)
-NOtes: look at race by gender interaction, 
- outcome should be time to death. Have Jiurui construct this bearing in mind the censoring variable

# Reports

- Interim report 1: investigate patterns of missing data and comment on potential for bias in analysis results in a report not to exceed 3 pages. Reproducible code should be provided in an appendix.
- Final report: prepare a report, not to exceed 5 pages and accompanied by useful visualizations, describing survival as a function of predictor variables of interest. Reproducible code should be provided in an appendix.
