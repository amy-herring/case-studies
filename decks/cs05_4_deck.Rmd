## Ovarian data

Recall the ovarian data: we will create a new dataset just with our redefined predictors for simplicity.

```{r ovarian2}
data(ovarian); library(mice); library(survival)
ovarian$residyes=ovarian$resid.ds-1 #2=yes goes to 1 and 1=no to 0
ovarian$trt1=2-ovarian$rx #1 stays 1 and 2 goes to 0
ovarian$ecog1=2-ovarian$ecog.ps
ovarian$age10=ovarian$age/10 #10-year difference for better interpretability
ovarian2=ovarian[,c(1:2,7:10)] #pick off just vars of interest
```


## Missing data in survival analysis

Suppose some of the variables in the ovarian data were subject to missing values. For example, perhaps the residual disease indicator has some missing values generated at random.

```{r genmissing}
set.seed=1213  #for reproducibility
#randomly sample 5 indices to set to missing (MCAR)
msng=round(runif(5,min=1,max=length(ovarian$residyes)))
#set residyes values corresponding to those indices to missing
ovarian2$residyes[msng]=NA
```

## Multiple imputation

```{r mi}
imp=mice(ovarian2,m=20)
coximpute=with(imp,coxph(Surv(futime,fustat)~age10+residyes+trt1+ecog1))
```

## Results
```{r pooling}
#note the pool function assumes infinite error df; not appropriate in small samples
#(this is a small sample!)
summary(pool(coximpute))
```

You can see only age is statistically significant using $p<0.05$ as a criterion in this analysis.
